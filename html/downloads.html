                <h1>Rabbit Hole Main Menu</h1>
                <p>
                    The Rabbit Hole Main Menu project was a personal project that I worked on in my spare time. I experienced some menus from a few indie games such as Ori and the Blind Forest and Hollow knight and thought to myself: “I wonder how easy it would be to make my own main menu for any games I make in the future?” And with that question, I set out on a journey to making a menu for a game I called Rabbit Hole. The goal of the project was to learn the ins and outs of how to make a solid main menu from the ground up.

                <h1>Deep Stone Crypt: Crypt Security Recreation in Unity</h1>
                <p>
                    Deep Stone Crypt: Crypt Security Recreation is a personal project that I took on in Unity. I play a game called Destiny 2 that is developed by Bungie. Within the game, there is an activity called a raid. Each raid is split up into a set of encounters where you are given a challenge or puzzle to solve. This encounter is one that I personally like a lot because of all the different ways it can be solved. Because of my deep fascination with the encounter design, I decided that I wanted to recreate their mechanics from the ground up. The goal of the project was to see how well I truly understood the rules of encounter and to code those rules myself.

                <h1>SpaceBall</h1>
                <p>
                    SpaceBall is a personal project that I created with the Unity Game Engine. This project was my first attempt at creating a game from scratch. I undertook this project after being inspired by a simple roll-a-ball game tutorial hosted by Unity. The concept of the game was simple, have a ball roll around and pick up orbs to win. The goal of the project was to learn how to build a game from scratch and to learn all the individual pieces needed to complete the project.

                <h1>Futuristic UI</h1>
                <p>
                    Futuristic UI is a personal project that I created with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The project was my first attempt at creating a flat style menu using tile-based flow. I learned about a modern approach to main menus called tile-based flow (found in games like Hitman). I also learned the importance of color and font selection for a menu. With all that being said, I wanted to understand how these game UI concepts would work for a website instead of a game’s menu system. The goal of the project was to replicate this UI concept in a web browser and see how closely I could get the website to look like a production game menu.

                <h1>MW3 Random Class Generator</h1>
                <p>
                    MW3 Random Class Generator is a personal project that I created using Visual Basic. After learning how to make a windows application in Visual Basic from scratch, I wanted to apply that knowledge to something I was passionate about. One problem I had a hard time finding a solution for was a loadout randomizer for a game called: Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3. The solutions that existed didn’t work the way I wanted them to so I decided to make my own. The goal of the project was to build a solution that I could share with all my friends that is simple so that anyone in the community could use it.

                <h1>Women’s Entrepreneur Network Summit Sales and Event Pages</h1>
                <p>
                    Women’s Entrepreneur Network Summit Sales and Event Pages is a professional website that I helped develop. This project was my first piece of professional work I was tasked with and the first piece of work that allowed me to showcase what I can do. The previous design left the event feeling unorganized and difficult to understand. My job was to redesign the website from the ground up to make sure that what the summit offered to attendees was clear and concise. I also had the challenge of making sure that the branding of the summit was in line with the previous web pages.

This site, unlike the WEN Summit, was a single page sales funnel designed to give you information about a service offering through WEN. My job was to redesign the page to be easier to use and understand with as little effort (from the user) as possible. I also had the challenge of making sure that the branding was consistent for both this page and other single sales pages that I needed to design in the future.
